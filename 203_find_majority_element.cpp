/*  13) Write a program in C to find the majority element of an array ? 
A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and 
hence there is at most one such element). 
Expected Output : 
The given array is : 4 8 4 6 7 4 4 8 
There are no Majority Elements in the given array.
